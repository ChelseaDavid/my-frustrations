		<h1>Things That Frustrate Me</h1>
		<p> When I look back at my life and reflect on my frustrations, I cringe, both for the
			situation itself, and my reaction as well. We've all been there. The grocery store clerk taking too long
			to help the customer in front of you ( only it's mostly just shooting the shit?) Or what about The driver
			you let in, only to go 5 MPH <em>under</em> the speed limit? Pretty understandable frustrations right?
			That co-worker who isnt pulling their weight. That neighbor who continually negates their overgrown tree
			growing over into your yard. Life is full of frustrations. Coding, in my opinion, will be no different.

		<h2>Ways I Intend to Manage my Frustrations</h2>
			<h4> Full Membership to StoneAge Rock Climbing gym</h4>
			<p> Rock climbing, for me, is one of the most therapeutic and relaxing gifts I can give to myself.
				I plan to spend as much time as I can, Sundays, working out any and all frustrations the week may
				have thrown my way. It also allows for a clear and ready mind to conquer the new week on Monday
